Phase 1: Initiation

Project Summary: 
This project is an an animal fun-fact program. The user is given 
a list of 10 different animals presented on the console, and the user can 
choose which animal they would like to learn about. Once they input their 
choice, the screen will display a fun fact about the user-selected animal. 

Phase 2: Planning

Project Management Plan:
1)	Display a list of 10 animals to the user
2)	Allow the user to select one animal at a time
3)	Error checking to make sure the user enters a valid selection each time
4)	Display the fun fact about the animal the user selected
5)	Allow the program to continue running until the user selects the option to exit

Phase 3: Execution
This program was expanded from the stubbing project and adjusted to 
meet the requirements of the animal fun fact program.
